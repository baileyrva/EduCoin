# EduCoin
This repository ("EduCoin") is an application that gives students a chance to earn their share of a digital currency while participating in their daily school lives. After earning currency the students can use it to purchase rewards or save it for future financial opportunities. 


## Installation

The application is deployed using github and heroku. The main pages can be opened in the browser. As a first time user they will signup as either a student or teacher. Afterwards, the teacher view will show the entire database, while the student's page will only display their individual record.
